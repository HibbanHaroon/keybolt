# Keybolt ⌨️⚡

Get ready for a typing test like no other! Keybolt brings your keyboard to life in 3D. Watch your typing speed soar as you see each key click. Challenge your friends and track your progress. It's typing, but cooler. 🔥💥

In this branch, I am just testing a small keyboard I made with spline and deployed it to see how it'll look like in a web browser. I have no clue but the keyboard is extremely slow on my laptop when I opened my website. However, it is working just fine on my friend's PC. So, I don't know what the issue is.

But, here you go if you've stumbled upon here... Do check it out this little small keyboard. (You'd be a lucky one if it works smoothly for you <3)
